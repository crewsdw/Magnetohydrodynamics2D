# Magnetohydrodynamics2D
Incompressible MHD in two dimensions with mixed discontinuous Galerkin / Fourier spectral method
Work in progress utilizing experimental spectral techniques

Project objectives mirror Incompressible2D:
    concisely-coded and efficient GPU implementations,
    some experimental spectral methods for the pressure Poisson equation and viscosity
