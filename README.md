# Magnetohydrodynamics2D
Incompressible MHD in two dimensions with mixed discontinuous Galerkin / Fourier spectral method

Variables: System solved in Elsasser formulation in 2D. Velocity and magnetic fields are in-plane.

Work in progress utilizing experimental spectral techniques

Project objectives mirror Incompressible2D:
1) concisely-coded and efficient GPU implementations,
2) some experimental spectral methods for the pressure Poisson equation and viscosity
